# Demand Forecasting with Smoothing and Moving Averages ðŸ“Š

---

## Overview

This project implements several basic time series forecasting techniques to predict future demand based on historical data. It includes functions for data cleaning, simple exponential smoothing, weighted moving average, and simple moving average. The results are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Features âœ¨

* **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values in the demand data by filling them with the mean of the series.
* **Forecasting Methods:** Implements the following techniques:
    * **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES):** Forecasts using a weighted average of past observations, with weights decreasing exponentially.
    * **3-Month Weighted Moving Average (WMA):** Calculates a forecast based on the average of the last 3 months, with user-defined weights.
    * **2-Month Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Calculates a forecast based on the simple average of the last 2 months.
* **Visualization:** Plots the original demand data against the forecasts generated by each method using `matplotlib`.
